Adds a new set of tinkering bit items that are analogous with scrap but for 8 of a given bit at a time. The idea is to make transferring bits between bodies a little more clean, but it also presents an opportunity to fill out the bit-lockers of tinker NPCs and to even convert a portion of their bits into these objects when they're slain.

With the addition of filled out `BitLocker`s for NPCs comes the natural progression to the idea that they should be able to perform tinkering actions for the player as part of a trade (beyond just repair and identify), which this mod also adds!

This mod depends on UnderDoug's [Vendor Actions](https://github.com/UnderDoug/UD_Vendor_Actions) mod to function.
